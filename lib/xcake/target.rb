    #

    # @return [String] the type of the target.
    #                  Can be `:application`, `:dynamic_library`,
    #                  `framework` or `:static_library`.
    #

    # @!group File patterns

    #
    #   File patterns do not support traversing the parent directory ( `..` ).
    #   File patterns may contain the following wildcard patterns:
    #
    #   ---
    #
    #   ### Pattern: *
    #
    #   Matches any file. Can be restricted by other values in the glob.
    #
    #   * `*` will match all files
    #   * `c*` will match all files beginning with `c`
    #   * `*c` will match all files ending with `c`
    #   * `*c*` will match all files that have `c` in them (including at the
    #     beginning or end)
    #
    #   Equivalent to `/.*/x` in regexp.
    #
    #   **Note** this will not match Unix-like hidden files (dotfiles). In
    #   order to include those in the match results, you must use something
    #   like `{*,.*}`.
    #
    #   ---
    #
    #   ### Pattern: **
    #
    #   Matches directories recursively.
    #
    #   ---
    #
    #   ### Pattern: ?
    #
    #   Matches any one character. Equivalent to `/.{1}/` in regexp.
    #
    #   ---
    #
    #   ### Pattern: [set]
    #
    #   Matches any one character in set.
    #
    #   Behaves exactly like character sets in Regexp, including set negation
    #   (`[^a-z]`).
    #
    #   ---
    #
    #   ### Pattern: {p,q}
    #
    #   Matches either literal `p` or literal `q`.
    #
    #   Matching literals may be more than one character in length. More than
    #   two literals may be specified.
    #
    #   Equivalent to pattern alternation in regexp.
    #
    #   ---
    #
    #   ### Pattern: \
    #
    #   Escapes the next meta-character.
    #
    #   ---
    #
    #   ### Examples
    #
    #   Consider these to be evaluated in the source root of
    #   [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit).
    #
    #       "JSONKit.?"    #=> ["JSONKit.h", "JSONKit.m"]
    #       "*.[a-z][a-z]" #=> ["CHANGELOG.md", "README.md"]
    #       "*.[^m]*"      #=> ["JSONKit.h"]
    #       "*.{h,m}"      #=> ["JSONKit.h", "JSONKit.m"]
    #       "*"            #=> ["CHANGELOG.md", "JSONKit.h"]
